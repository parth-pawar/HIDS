⚠️ Suspicious Windows Processes

cmd.exe → command prompt
powershell.exe → script execution / exploitation
wscript.exe / cscript.exe → Windows Script Host (used to run malicious VBS/JS scripts)
mshta.exe → can run malicious HTML applications
rundll32.exe → used to execute DLL payloads
regsvr32.exe → can register DLLs remotely
wmic.exe → WMI execution (often used by attackers for recon/exec)
taskkill.exe / tasklist.exe → attackers often kill security processes
net.exe / net1.exe → user/group enumeration, service control
at.exe / schtasks.exe → persistence by scheduling tasks
mimikatz.exe → (if present, almost always malicious)



Processes you can safely demonstrate (and how)

1) notepad.exe (easy, harmless)

Command (Run from Run box or cmd):
Expected HIDS behavior: Suspicious process detected: notepad.exe.
Good for: quick demo that process monitoring works.

2) cmd.exe (command prompt)
Command:
start "" cmd.exe /k "echo demo && pause"
Expected: Suspicious process detected: cmd.exe.
Use case: show attacker might get a shell.

3) powershell.exe (PowerShell)
Command (PowerShell or cmd):
start "" powershell.exe -NoProfile -WindowStyle Normal -Command "Start-Sleep -Seconds 60"
Expected: Suspicious process detected: powershell.exe.
Use case: demonstrates script execution detection.

4) wmic.exe (WMI execution)
Command (cmd):
wmic process call create "notepad.exe"
Expected: detection of notepad.exe (and optionally wmic.exe if in your suspicious list).
Notes: wmic is often used for remote/automated execution in attacks — good to show.

5) schtasks.exe (scheduled task)
Create a task that runs immediately (harmlessly launches Notepad):
schtasks /Create /SC ONCE /TN DemoTask /TR "notepad.exe" /ST 23:59 /F
schtasks /Run /TN DemoTask
Expected: Suspicious process detected: schtasks.exe (if in list) and notepad.exe when the task runs.
After demo, delete the task:
schtasks /Delete /TN DemoTask /F

6) mshta.exe (HTML Application host) — safe demo
Open a simple blank mshta instance:
mshta "about:blank"
Expected: Suspicious process detected: mshta.exe (if monitored).
Note: mshta can run malicious HTML apps — only run blank/benign pages.

7) wscript.exe / cscript.exe (Windows Script Host)
Create a tiny VBS file C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\hello.vbs:
MsgBox "HIDS demo"
Run with:
wscript.exe "C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\hello.vbs"
Expected: Suspicious process detected: wscript.exe or cscript.exe (if monitored).
